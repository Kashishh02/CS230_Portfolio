# CS230 Portfolio - Software Design Document

## Artifact
This repository contains the software design document created for *The Gaming Room* project.

## Reflection

### Client and Software Requirements
The client was *The Gaming Room*. They wanted to expand their existing Android game, *Draw It or Lose It*, into a multi-platform web application. The system needed to support multiple instances, multiple teams, and scalability.

### What I Did Well
I organized the document clearly and explained my design decisions in a way that could be understood by both technical and non-technical audiences.

### Helpful Part of the Process
Breaking the project into sections with the design document made development much easier and less overwhelming.

### What I Would Revise
If I could revise anything, I would simplify and clean up the UML diagrams so they match the descriptions more closely.

### Interpreting User Needs
I focused on the client’s need for scalability and multi-platform support. Considering user needs ensures the design is practical and useful.

### Design Approach and Future Strategies
I gathered requirements, compared platforms, and created detailed designs. In the future, I’d add more user stories and testing scenarios earlier to catch gaps sooner.
